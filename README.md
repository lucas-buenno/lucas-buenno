I'm Lucas, a UX Designer transitioning into a software engineer, based in Minas Gerais, Brazil.

I currently work as a Product Designer and I’m fully focused on becoming a Software Engineer soon. My goal is to help build products that truly make a difference in people’s lives and businesses.

I’m fascinated about technology, high-impact products, and driven by curiosity. I’ve helped design solutions in the private pension, travel, and crypto industries. I hope to keep doing that, soon from a software engineer.

Outside of work, I’m into everything football-related (especially jersey designs!), cold beers, and barbecue. I also enjoy playing video games, bar hopping, and trying new things now and then.


Let’s connect!
